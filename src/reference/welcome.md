Emojicode is a language that aims to provide the most modern and powerful
features to make it easy, fast and fun to write programs. These powerful
features include classes, optionals, which can handle the absence of a value,
generics, closures and much more.

Emojicode is a strongly typed language, which means that the compiler will
verify that all of your operations are correct.

Although Emojicode only uses Emojis to express the program’s structure, it is
similar to programming languages you might know, like C.

The whole Language Reference & Guide assumes that you have a basic
understanding of programming. This is not a tutorial but mainly describes
the features of Emojicode and its use cases.
